# Hovering-Ball-Controlling-Agent
A Small Learning Project where I experimented with mixing physics simulation and reinforcement learning. Built mainly to understand how agents learn through trial and error. The focus here is exploration and learning, not optimization. Still improving and learning as I go.

# 🚀 Project Setup & Run Guide

This project is a **beginner-level experiment** where I explore **physics simulation + basic AI/RL ideas**.
It includes **simulation code** and **learning logic**, built mainly for understanding and practice 🧠✨

---

## 🛠️ Environment Setup

### ✅ Prerequisites

Make sure you have these installed on your system:

* 🐍 **Python 3.13.0**
* 💻 **C++ Compiler**

  * Windows: MinGW / MSVC
  * Linux/Mac: g++ / clang
* 📦 **pip** (Python package manager)

---

### 📦 Install Python Dependencies

Open terminal / command prompt inside the project folder and run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This installs all required Python libraries needed for the project to run smoothly.

---

## ▶️ How to Run the Project

### 🟢 Step 1: Run the Learning / AI Logic / Graphics

Run the simulation or environment file:

```Terminal
python DQ_network.py
```

This will:

* Launch the Training Phase + Learning visuals 🎮
* Show the environment where learning happens
* Learning logic
* Decision making
* Training behavior over time 📈

---

### 🔵 (Optional) C++ Physics Module

If you want to compile and run the C++ physics code:

```bash
g++ object_physics.cpp -o physics
./physics
```

This part is used to:

* Understand low-level physics logic
* Experiment with performance and calculations ⚙️

---

## 🚦 How to Start (Quick Guide)

1️⃣ Clone the repository
2️⃣ Install dependencies
3️⃣ Run the simulation
4️⃣ Start the learning script
5️⃣ Observe how behavior improves over time 👀✨

---

## 🧪 Project Status

* ✅ Beginner-friendly
* 🧠 Learning-focused
* 🚧 Still experimenting & improving
* 📚 Built mainly for understanding AI + simulation concepts

---

## 🌱 Why This Project?

I built this as a **learning experiment**, not a production system.
The goal is to **understand concepts deeply** by building things from scratch — even if they’re simple.

If you’re learning AI, RL, or simulations too — feel free to explore, modify, and break things 😄
